# Git Practice

Why did I choose this?
When I was working on the Scrum quiz I was a bit unsure about what the "Cone of Uncertainty", ironic as that is. So I did some research and clicked through a bunch of articles.
After a bit of searching, I stumbled upon this article. The graphic at the top immediately caught my eye and I found myself reading the full article, which is suprising as I tend to be a skimmer. 
I liked how straightforward the author's diction was. They outlined the ways in which all projects are unique. As a basic concept, I already had acknowledged that all projects are unique. But under the surface I had subconsciously considered SWE a potentially repetitive field. However, the author really opened my eyes to all the factors that differentiate projects. For example, working with different teams and third parties can completely change the work-place dynamic and re-invigorate a project! 

A simple project to practice a few git/github workflows.  Replace the contents of this file with the contents indicated in the [instructions](./instructions.md).
